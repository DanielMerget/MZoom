TL;DR: Do whatever you like, just don't sue me, okay? :-)

The MagCapture code and files were taken from the Microsoft Windows Magnifier API examples and adapted to support multi-threading, some controls, etc. Please refer to the respective license.
More information on Magnifier API: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms692402(v=vs.85).aspx#system_cursor

TreadPool.h was taken from https://github.com/progschj/ThreadPool/blob/master/COPYING#L1
Please refer to the respective license.

The way I understand it (IANAL), the Microsoft license forces me to use their license for my modifications as well.

In case I am allowed to use a different license (again, IANAL), any portions of the code that do not automatically fall under either of the above licenses are licensed under the following MIT license:
